# Face-Recognition-System-Using-Local-Binary-Pattern-Features
This face recognition system uses Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features to extract facial details efficiently. LBP compares each pixel with its neighbors and creates a binary code that describes local textures. This helps recognize faces accurately even with changes in lighting or facial expressions.
